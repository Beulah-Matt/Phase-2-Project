This project started about two weeks before I joined Moringa, as a gift to a friend who is championing mental health in Kenya and wanted a customised blog site. Though it is far from being a workable presentation, I hope to finally get it there soon.
#Components
I have created several components, most of them for re-usability. The title and sub-title components for example will be used throughout all of the sections of this website. 

#Routes.
Clicking on an image on the slide-show will route you to the blogs section of this project.
