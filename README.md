This project started about two weeks before I joined Moringa, as a gift to a friend who is championing mental health in Kenya and wanted a customised blog site. Though it is far from being a workable presentation, I hope to finally get it there soon.

#Components
I have created several components, most of them for re-usability. The title and sub-title components for example will be used throughout all of the sections of this website. App.js is the parent component and renders props to the rest that need them.

#Routes
All items on the NavBar will lead to a specific page, utilizing react routes for client-side routing. Additionally, some display cards and buttons will redirect to specific pages. 

#User Experience
As a user, these are some of the features:
-Click on the Article button to read more articles while the read more button leads you to the about section.
-You can edid and post blog posts from the Write page.
-Search for blogs by title.
-Browse through some of the available blogs from home page.
-Send a message to the author.
-Fully responsive design that works with all screen sizes.

Setup Instructions

Copyright
I was able to work on this project through help from numerous techies who are generous with information out there. My classmates have been immensely
supportive too and I hope I can do the same. Most definitely feel free to use this for ideas on your next project and to learn something new!

Happy hacking :-)
