This project is a prototype for a blog, where a user can pen down their best ideas and share them with a willing audience. I chose a blog to incorporate writing and tech, two things I am passionate about. With fine tuning, this could potentially be hosted by a user in any of the blogging providers like Wordpress.

#Components
I have created several components, most of them for re-usability. The title and sub-title components for example will be used throughout all of the sections of this website. App.js is the parent component and renders props to the rest that need them.

#Routes
All items on the NavBar will lead to a specific page, utilizing react routes for client-side routing. Additionally, some display cards and buttons will redirect to specific pages. 

#User Experience
As a user, these are some of the features:
-Click on the Article button to read more articles while the Read More button leads you to the about section.
-You can edit and post blog posts from the Write page.
-Search for blogs by title.
-Browse through some of the available blogs from home page.
-Send a message to the author.
-Fully responsive design that works with all screen sizes.

Setup Instructions
All of the files and dependencies for this project have been uploaded on github. Cloning or downloading this repo will get you going on fine. To view this on your browser, run npm start.
Components for the landing page have been rendered in pages/home file.

Copyright
I was able to work on this project through help from numerous techies who are generous with information out there. My classmates have been immensely
supportive too and I hope I can do the same. Most definitely feel free to use this for ideas on your next project and to learn something new!

Happy hacking :-)
